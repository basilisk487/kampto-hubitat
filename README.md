DRIVERS: Instructions on adding/changeing Drivers (Device Handlers).

To add a driver to Hubitat. First go to Hubitat "Drivers Code". Click "New Driver". Copy the Driver code from Github. Paste into the blank new drivers page. Hit Save.

To use new added Driver. First go to Hubitat "Devices". Find the device you want to use this new driver with and open device. Go to Device information and "Type" drop down.
Select the new Driver near the bottom of the list. Click "Save Device". Scroll up and change any "Prefernces" you want if any. Click "Save Prevernces". All done. 

If you copy this driver into an existing driver and save, you will need to go to the Device and save preferences for it to take.

If needed go to dashboard and edit the Device tile to enable what attributes you want to be displayed.
SharpTools and other frontends: If you switch to a DH with extra attributes you will need to go (Hubitat) Apps - sharptools - next - done, to get them to take. 

No guarantee these device handlers will work with new Smartthings App (2020 and beyond). They may not even compile in the ST IDE. I have no plans to try to get them to work on ST.
